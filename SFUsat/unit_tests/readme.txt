UNIT TESTS

This folder contains unit tests designed mostly, to verify hardware. 

Code that is written during driver development would be the ideal thing to place in here. Short, sweet, simple sequences. 

Appropriate HALCoGen Settings must be declared in the c file. 

It is ok to call existing test code located in driver files, for example.
